# Kaprekar Kernal

This programs take a four digit, positive number where not all digits and computes its Kaprekar Kernal. A Kaprekar Kernal is produced from a series of Kaprekar Operations. Kaprekar Operations are computed by sorting all the digits from greatest to least and subtracting it from least to greatest. The Kaprekar Kernal is defined when the Kaprekar Operation starts to give you the same number every time. For four digit inputs the Kaprekar Kernal is always 6174.

**Future Updates: I might add one in Java that uses the Merge Sort Algorithm and OOP classes.**
