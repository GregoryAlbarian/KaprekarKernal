# Kaprekar Kernel

This programs take a four digit, positive number where not all digits and computes its Kaprekar Kernel. A Kaprekar Kernel is produced from a series of Kaprekar Operations. Kaprekar Operations are computed by sorting all the digits from greatest to least and subtracting it from least to greatest. The Kaprekar Kernel is defined when the Kaprekar Operation starts to give you the same number every time. For four digit inputs the Kaprekar Kernel is always 6174.
