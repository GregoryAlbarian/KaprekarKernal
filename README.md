# Kaprekar Kernel

This programs take a four digit, positive number where not all digits and computes its Kaprekar Kernel. A Kaprekar Kernel is produced from a series of Kaprekar Operations. Kaprekar Operations are computed by sorting all the digits from greatest to least and subtracting it from least to greatest. The Kaprekar Kernel is defined when the Kaprekar Operation starts to give you the same number every time. For four digit inputs the Kaprekar Kernel is always 6174.

__Startup Instructions (in Linus)__  
_this program has only been tested in Linus Ubuntu for WSL_  
_If you need to install python3 still then type:_  

> sudo apt-get install python3  

_Go to the place where you would like to store your program_  

> git clone https://github.com/GregoryAlbarian/KaprekarKernel.git  

_Then type:_  

> cd KaprekarKernel  

> python3 KaprekarKernel.py  
_just to emphasize this program has no command line arguments to deal with_  
_you should then be prompted to give a number proper for calculations_
